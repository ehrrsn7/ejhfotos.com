            <br />
            <strike>
            <li>Figure out which buttons need to be implemented (see dashboard page, etc)</li>
            <br />
            <li><Tab />Evenly space nav buttons on each page, using grid or columns?</li>
            </strike>
            <br />
            <strike>
            <li>Funky header spacing on mobile, seems to be a fixed height. Maybe mess with min/max height?</li>
            <br />
            </strike>
            <strike>
            <li><Tab />Update: problem seems to have gone away, but absolute positioning of logo is still weird.</li>
            <br />
            </strike>
            <li><Tab />Update: header is simplified, still gets kinda funky but no longer janky. Everything is fairly evenly spaced with no overlap. Update: could use an overhaul. Right now, it's just a wrapper with almost no overhead, just the 'header' tag and some flexbox styling.</li>
            <br />
            <strike>
            <li>MasonryLayout finished. Still acts funky (update: padding fixed, hot reload gets kinda jumpy. This probably won't be a problem in production, but you never know. update: call update helper function when dropdown selection hook is modified. [todo: implement selection hook]).</li>
            <br />
            </strike>
            <strike>
            <li>
               <Tab />Update: I never needed to use the callback function in the first place. <br />
               <Tab />I ended up creating a React State ([default val == 10]) called gridRowEnd and passing it to the style prop of MasonryLayout. <br />
               <Tab />Then I refactored the helper function to be a getGridRowEnd calculator instead of a callback calculator/setter function. <br />
               <Tab />The problem there was how to access the element on the dom, since we weren't using our document.querySelectorAll function anymore. This was fixed by using React.useRef and passing ref as a prop called ref to the Card element. That's fucking magical. üôåüèΩ (<em><a href="https://media.tenor.com/ERa47gPVan8AAAAM/the-more-you-know.gif">‚ú®‚ú®the more you know‚ú®‚ú®</a></em>)
            </li>
            <br />
            <li><Tab />I left out if I had tested the jumpiness. In a sense, it's almost completely fixed via the use of the gridRowEnd state hook. However, I haven't tested dynamically creating/removing cards (which I expect to be doing a lot of with the task-tracker app. Currently, it's not urgent because my only use case for it is the simple dropdown ui cards [update, discard, show more, etc.]), but I ultimately want to use it for something like pinterest: the cards themselves can be the table rows.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Implement columnwidth prop. It doesn't need to be a reactive hook, just a prop that doesn't change dynamically. It just needs to be used to set a css variable (pretty easy to google the solution, I believe it's just <code>element.style.setProperty(prop, value)</code></li>
            <br />
            </strike>
            <li><Tab />Update: The MasonryLayout works perfect.</li>
            <br />
            <strike>
            <li>Figure out vite external includes when building. It currently throws an error.</li>
            <br />
            <li><Tab />Update: current workaround = manually copying and pasting to avoid build errors... I think I'm gonna need help from somebody or completely refactor to some monorepo paradigm.</li>
            <li><Tab />I looked up lots of things before giving up: how a repo works, the monolithic repo paradigm, how packages work in npm, possibly publishing a private helper package to npm (this seems to be the only thing that really fixes my problem. Also, it might be the only "best practice"; I'd really rather my components reside in my project workspace so there are less moving parts, but in reality I should be doing TDD (testing/refactoring my components) making them as low-overhead as possible so I never have to edit them again... so maybe)</li>
            <li><Tab />Another update ‚Äî I found these urls: <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#git-urls-as-dependencies">https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#git-urls-as-dependencies</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16350673/depend-on-a-branch-or-tag-using-a-git-url-in-a-package-json">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16350673/depend-on-a-branch-or-tag-using-a-git-url-in-a-package-json</a></li>
            <br />
            </strike>
            <li>Update: I put all my components in an isolated npm package called ehrrsn7-components managed using npm publish.</li><br />
            <li>Implement toast. (put under "absolute content in app.jsx")</li>
            <br />
            <li>Implement Slideshow. Shouldn't be too crazy.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Implement Flipbox. (Shouldn't be too crazy.)</li>
            <br />
            <li>For hero images on my main site...use the onload callback prop on image tags to introduce delayed fade-in effect for high-res images to that it's not super taxing on peoples' computers (also, find a solution for hosting low-res images and putting them in a collection -- google drive, firebase, an album on google photos? bonus if you can let the main site be automatically populated by the contents of this collection.)</li>
            <br />
            <li>I don't know why I didn't think of this before... put my demos on replit.com!!!!!!</li>
