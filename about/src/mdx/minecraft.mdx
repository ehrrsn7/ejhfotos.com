# minecraft.ejhfotos.com

This web server doesn't exist (i.e. there is no port that minecraft.ejhfotos.com:80 will reroute to).

However, this minecraft server does exist on port 25565 (ejhfotos.com:25565 running any subdomain). This is the default port for minecraft: java edition, so if the input is just the domain, the port '25565' will be implied.

Copy and paste this <code style={{hover: "cursor"}} onClick={event => {
   try {
      const textToCopy = event.target.innerHTML
      if (!navigator.clipboard)
         throw new Error(`Cannot copy '${textToCopy}': navigator.clipboard does not exist. This is probably due to insufficient permissions, such as using the http protocol instead of https.`)
      navigator.permissions?.query({ name: "write-on-clipboard" }).then((result) => {
         if (result.state == "granted" || result.state == "prompt")
            alert("Write access granted!")
      })
      navigator.clipboard?.writeText(textToCopy).then(() => {
         console.log('Content copied to clipboard')
         /* Resolved - text copied to clipboard successfully */
      }, () => {
         throw new Error('Failed to copy')
         /* Rejected - text failed to copy to the clipboard */
      })
   }
   catch (err) {
      console.warn(err)
   }

Last thing: players are not allowed in by default. [Contact me]() to get whitelisted.
